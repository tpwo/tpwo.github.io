        <article>
            <section id="preamble" aria-label="Preamble"><p>I recently switched from a Windows laptop to a Macbook Pro 2019 with Intel chip at my job.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used Mac before, so I wanted to describe what I&#8217;m setting up, as I&#8217;m migrating.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_enable_tap_to_click">Enable tap to click</h2><p>It&#8217;s funny, but I found it as a recommended first step
when configuring a new mac.</p>
<p>By default to have actual click with the trackpad,
you have to press it until it clicks.
But with the mentioned option enabled,
tap is enough.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_invert_scroll">Invert scroll</h2><p>I&#8217;m used to a way of scrolling where I scroll down,
and the content also scrolls down.</p>
<p>The inverse of that is default in MacOS.
At first, I thought it&#8217;s impossible to change it,
but it turned out the option is there,
but it has a weird name:
<em>natural scrolling</em>,
where "content tracks finger movement".</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true, but in my opinion it makes more sense
when using touch screen,
where you have a direct connection between fingers and the content.</p>
<p>But maybe I&#8217;ll switch to this option,
as it seesm to be default also on other platforms (Windows).</p>
<p>TODO: check if it&#8217;s really the default behavior on Windows.</p>
<p>Why: when using someone&#8217;s else machine, it&#8217;s more likely
that they&#8217;ll have the default settings.</p>
<p>From the same reason, it isn&#8217;t wise to create a lot of
personal bindings in ubiquitous tools like Vim.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_remap_action_keys">Remap action keys</h2><p>On all of my Windows machines i remap CapsLock key to Control,
as CapsLock is almost never used, and can be easily replaced
with just pressing Shift.
And at the same time, it&#8217;s located in the home row,
which means it&#8217;s very easy to reach.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a terminal, tmux, and Vim (or at least Vim-bindings) user,
so easy-to-access Control has a lot of sense for me.</p>
<p>On Windows I have to use external tool called Ctrl2Cap
(althogh written by a Microsoft employee).</p>
<p>On MacOS, you can do the remap directly in the OS,
for at least few years.
I&#8217;m doing the same CapsLock &#8594; Control remapping.</p>
<p>TODO: I found people recommending the following setup for CapsLock:
when pressed it should servce as Esc;
when you hold it, it should as as Control.
It sounds cool, but requires more complex setup
both on Windows and MacOS.
But I guess I should investigate that,
as it would make using Vim a bit more efficient
(now I&#8217;m using <code>Ctrl + [</code> to exit from the insert mode).</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_remapping_keys_on_windows_type_keyboard">Remapping keys on Windows-type keyboard</h3><p>I have a docking station with monitors and external keyboard and mouse.
Of course, this setup is a classic Windows-compatible solution.
I quickly learnt that Windows and Mac keyboards are way different than you may think.
Especially when talking about action keys.</p>
<p>The problem is that MacOS has one more action key that Windows:
Command key.
That means, some of the functionality,
I&#8217;m used into with Ctrl/Alt,
on Mac is done with Command.</p>
<p>I understand it like that:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>Fn key is the same as Fn in Windows
(most commonly laptops)</li><li>Option key is Windows Alt
(it even was named like that on Mac in older times).
E.g. when typing Polish characters.
But Command key sometimes is used instead.</li><li>Command key is sometimes acting as Windows Control (e.g. in Chrome, closing tab is Ctrl/Command + W)</li><li>But sometimes it acts as Windows Alt (e.g. Alt+Tab to switch Windows is Command+Tab)</li></ul></div>
<p>The recommended solution I found,
is to remap Windows Alt to Command
(so Alt+Tab etc. works like on Windows)
and remap Windows Key to Alt</p>
<p>TODO: insert screenshot with the mapping.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_unsolved_issues">Unsolved issues</h3><p>I still am figuring out how to properly solve the Polish characters typing
when using remapped Windows keyboard.</p>
<p>By default on Mac it&#8217;s done with Option which would be fine,
<em>if I haven&#8217;t done</em> the remapping.
With remapped keys,
I can only type in Polish characters with the Windows key,
which is on the wrong side of space.</p>
<p>I heard about software to remap keys
(similar to Windows AutoHotkey),
namely Karabiner.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not sure if it can solve this issue.
I&#8217;m still looking for a ready solution,
as I cannot believe that I&#8217;m the only person with such an issue.</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_install_homebrew">Install homebrew</h2><p>MacOS doesn&#8217;t come with a package manager in a classic Unix way.
There is an appstore app, but it&#8217;s more like a smartphone solution,
than something like apt registries.</p>
<p><code>homebrew</code> fixes that.
I only started to use it,
but it looks like a <code>winget</code> for MacOS.
I guess that recipes are added by people,
and so far I haven&#8217;t found software,
which isn&#8217;t available there.
With the only exception being paid software.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_findings">Findings</h3><p>I noticed that homebrew has at least two "install types".
One of them is standard <code>brew install &lt;recipe-name&gt;</code>.
But some apps require an additional flag:
<code>brew install --kask &lt;recipe-name&gt;</code>.
Also then, I have to provide my password to install the app.
I noticed that it&#8217;s used for desktop apps.
It might be connected with moving the app to the <code>Applications</code> folder;
which is, quite a strange way, to "install" something on MacOS.</p>
<p>TODO: verify the above.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_software_to_install">Software to install</h3><div class="ulist"><ul><li>developer tools (prompted by the system when trying to run Git)</li><li><code>brew install ripgrep</code> (for Neovim plugins)</li><li><code>brew install gh</code> (GitHub CLI)</li><li><code>brew install bash-completion@2</code></li><li><code>brew install doll</code></li><li><code>brew install neovim</code></li><li><code>brew install htop</code></li><li><code>brew install tmux</code></li></ul></div>
<p>GUI apps:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><code>brew install --cask iterm2</code></li><li><code>brew install --cask appcleaner</code></li><li><code>brew install --cask --no-quarantine middleclick</code> (TODO: check why these flags are here)</li><li><code>brew install --cask keepassxc</code></li><li><code>brew install --cask visual-studio-code</code></li><li><code>brew install --cask spotify</code></li></ul></div></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_change_default_shell">Change default shell</h2><p>MacOS switched from Bash to zsh a few years ago.
I use Bash on my every other system,
and I didn&#8217;t want to learn a new shell just for one platform.
Migrating from Bash to zsh on other platform is impractical,
as Bash is the de facto standard in the industry
when talking about Linux platforms.</p>
<p>There is a <code>chsh</code> command whcih allows to change a shell easily.</p>
<p>But another caveat is the Bash version shiped with MacOS
is a pretty old 3.2.
And the newest version is 5.X.
This caused some issues with my dotfiles
(namely <code>globstar</code> shell option missing in 3.2).</p>
<p>I read that the reason is licensing.
It turns out that Bash changed it license some time ago,
and Apple cannot legally ship its newest version with its OS.</p>
<p>Fortunately it&#8217;s easy to install newest Bash with homebrew.
Note that in order for <code>chsh</code> to be able to switch it,
you have to edit a file in <code>/etc/</code> with root permissions
(TODO: provide path to the actual file),
and add installed newer version of Bash
(<code>/usr/local/bin/bash</code>, TODO: confirm path).</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_install_bash_completion">Install <code>bash-completion</code></h2><p>After you install Bash,
you can quickly notice
that something is wrong&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;tab completions are missing.</p>
<p>It may not seem like much,
but this adds a lot of little annoyances.</p>
<p>Fortunately, homebrew has a recipe to install them.
When using newer Bash from brew,
you have to install <code>@2</code> version of the recipe.</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre>brew install bash-completion@2</pre></div>
<p>Then, you have to source downloaded file in your <code>.bashrc</code>.
For that, I use a little utility function
which does <code>-r</code> on the path
(checks if a file is readable)
before sourcing it.</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="bash">_source_if<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="nb">test</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can use it:</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre>_source_if "/usr/local/opt/bash-completion@2/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"</pre></div>
<p>Remember that you can use <code>brew --prefix bash-completion@2</code>
to get the correct path.
I decided to use hardcoded path,
as running <code>brew --prefix</code> takes some time to execute,
when you add it to your <code>.bashrc</code>.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_install_git_completions">Install Git completions</h2><p>I noticed that Git installed in Mac doesn&#8217;t ship with tab completion.
I read something about it,
I noticed it, as my <code>$PS1</code> uses <code>__git_ps1</code> which wasn&#8217;t available.</p>
<p>I found that you can download the completions file manually.</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre>mkdir -p ~/.local/completions
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash \
  -o ~/.local/completions/</pre></div>
<p>In your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre>_source_if "$HOME/.local/completions/.git-completion.bash"</pre></div>
<aside class="admonition-block note" role="note"><h6 class="block-title label-only"><span class="title-label">Note: </span></h6><p>this is not an ideal solution,
as it freezes the version of Git completions.
But Git is a stable program, so I guess it&#8217;s good enough.</p></aside>
<p>TODO: check if the above can be done in a better way easily.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_install_iterm2">Install iterm2</h2><p>Default terminal in MacOS is similar to Windows.
It&#8217;s not so great.
Even before switching to Mac I heard about iterm.
I did a quick search if it&#8217;s still a viable option,
and after confirming it,
I immediately switched.</p>
<p>I found that some people are using different tools
like Alactricity (TODO: fix name) which is written in Rust and is multiplatform.
But at the beginning I wanted to have something battle tested and stable,
so I know that any issues are caused by me,
rather than the issues with the tool itself.
Maybe, I&#8217;ll swithc in the future.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_swich_from_bsd_to_gnu_utils">Swich from BSD to GNU utils</h2><p>After importing my dotfiles,
I quickly noticed that there are some issues with Unix tools.
Namely <code>ls --group-directories-first</code> was a problem.
It turns out BSD <code>ls</code> doesn&#8217;t have this flag.</p>
<p>I was aware about big differences in other tools like <code>sed</code>,
but I didn&#8217;t know that even <code>ls</code> is impacted.</p>
<p>Later I also noticed that BSD <code>xargs</code> doesn&#8217;t support <code>--delimiter</code> flag,
so there are a lot of small annoyances.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can install missing utils via <code>brew</code>,
and <strong>prepend</strong> them to your <code>PATH</code>,
so they take precedence.</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre>brew install coreutils
brew install findutils
brew install gnu-sed</pre></div>
<p>Then you can use <code>brew --prefix coreutils</code>
to see where the binaries were downloaded.</p>
<p>In fact, they are a bit hidden in subfolders:</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre>/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin
/usr/local/opt/findutils/libexec/gnubin
/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin</pre></div>
<p>Add these two in the beginning of your <code>PATH</code>
and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll share a little convenient function I use in my <code>.bashrc</code>
to do this easily.
It tests if a given folder exists before adding it,
so you can leave it also on other platforms
if you share your dotfiles between machines.</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre class="rouge highlight"><code data-lang="bash">,pathprepend<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">for </span>arg <span class="k">in</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$@</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do

<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_install_appcleaner">Install AppCleaner</h2><p>Theoretically, uninstalling an app in MacOS
is just moving it to the trash.
I quickly found out that life isn&#8217;t so simple in practice.
In fact, a lot of apps is not fully uninstalled,
leaving configuration files behind.
It&#8217;s very annoying when you&#8217;re trying to do a clean reinstall.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not surprising&#8201;&#8211;&#8201;there&#8217;s a solution for that provided by a 3rd party.
It&#8217;s called AppCleaner, it&#8217;s free, and can be installed via their website or homebrew.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_install_middleclick">Install MiddleClick</h2><p>It turns out that MacOS doesn&#8217;t support middle mouse click
with trackpad gesture.</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised to learn that.</p>
<p>Like in many other cases, there is a tool for that.</p>
<p>It can be installed from here:
<a class="bare" href="https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/middleclick">https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/middleclick</a></p>
<p>It requires special permissions,
but then works fine without any issues.</p>
<p>TODO: I noticed that MiddleClick doesn&#8217;t load automatically
after I reboot my Mac.
I have to figure out how to change it.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_install_doll">Install Doll</h2><p>MacOS doesn&#8217;t have any native support for tray icons for apps.
The only way to have a tray icon is for the app to define it.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see that most apps don&#8217;t have them defined,
e.g. Slack or Teams.
Coming from Windows this was a big difference,
but fortunately I found and app called <code>Doll</code>
which is able to handle that.</p>
<p>Again, it can be installed with homebrew:
<a class="bare" href="https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/doll">https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/doll</a></p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_figure_out_ssh_agent">Figure out SSH agent</h2><p>TODO: it seems that Git is more stable when using SSH.
I see errors with HTTP when pushing big branches to forks.</p>
<p>I have to check if MacOS has a good approach to SSH agent.
Windows does, at it works pretty well for me,
for I&#8217;m hopeful that it&#8217;s more or less the same with Mac.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_install_python">Install Python</h2><p>I noticed that <code>uv</code> can be a good choice on MacOS, as it supports installing a lot of Python versions with a single command.</p>
<p><a class="bare" href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/">https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/</a></p>
<p>I noticed that you can add installed versions to PATH,
so they are correctly detected by tools like <code>tox</code>.</p>
<div class="listing-block"><pre>ln -s /Users/twojdat/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.8.20-macos-x86_64-none/bin/python3 ~/.local/bin/python3.8</pre></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_ending_notes">Ending notes</h2><p>I&#8217;m sure this list is not complete.
And probably it would take me a few times,
to add other points to it.
But I wanted to write it having all the experiences fresh in mind,
so I can refine it and iterate on it later.</p></section>
